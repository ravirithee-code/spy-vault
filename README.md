The project I created here is tiltled spy-vault which based on the theme spy since I like it. Actually this is a school project but since  I like coding and creating things a little advanced than 
my current level, I created something really fun and at the same time interesting web where it works like a normal calculator first until you give a specified secret code which then directes to 
a web where one need to login to further proceed. After providing username and password it directs the user to vault web where one can upload files, conert texts to caesar, or to encode morse
code. The only interesting thing is that I created all these with only python, html, css  as only these are allwed even after my request to the teacher for my project.I hope you liked it!.😅😃😃
